# Web Table Data Extraction with Selenium WebDriver

This Java code demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver to extract data from a web table and export it to a CSV file. The code is designed to work with web pages containing tables and can be adapted for various use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- **Java Development Environment:** Ensure you have Java installed on your computer.
- **WebDriver Setup:** [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) is used for setting up the WebDriver. Ensure you have the necessary WebDriver for your browser (e.g., Firefox) configured.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse).

3. Run the `ReadTable` class.

4. The code will:
   - Navigate to a web page with a table (`http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/challenging_dom` in this example).
   - Locate the table element.
   - Extract data from the table and export it to a CSV file with a timestamp.

## Customization

- **Web Page URL:** You can change the web page URL by modifying the `driver.get("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/challenging_dom");` line.

- **Browser Selection:** The code is set up for Firefox. If you prefer a different browser, you can modify it in the setup section.

- **CSV File Name:** The exported CSV file is named with a timestamp (`webtable_MM-dd-yy-HH-mm-ss.csv`). You can customize the file name in the code.
